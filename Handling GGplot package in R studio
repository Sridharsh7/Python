ep 1: Load the ggplot2 library Step 2: Supply sample data. Step 3: Create a scatter plot Step 4: Print the results.
SOURCE CODE
# Load the ggplot2 library library(ggplot2)
# Sample data
data <- data.frame( X = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
Y = c(2, 3, 1, 4, 2)
)
# Create a scatter plot ggplot(data, aes(x = X, y = Y)) + geom_point() +
labs(title = "Scatter Plot Example", x = "X-axis", y = "Y-axis")

OUTPUT



RESULT
Thus the ggplot package has been handled and demonstrated successfully
