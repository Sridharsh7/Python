AIM:

To calculate the Frequency distribution in R programming.

PROCEDURE:

A data sample is called qualitative, also known as categorical, if its values belong to a collection of known defined non-overlapping classes. Common examples include student letter grade (A, B, C, D or F), commercial bond rating (AAA, AAB,) and consumer clothing shoe sizes (1, 2, 3,).
The tutorials in this section are based on an R built-in data frame named painters. It is a compilation of technical information of a few eighteenth century classical painters. The data set belongs to the MASS package, and has to be pre-loaded into the R workspace prior to its use.







Da Udine	10	8	16	3	A
Da Vinci	15	16	4	14	A
Del Piombo	8	13	16	7	A
Del Sarto	12	16	9	8	A
Fr. Penni	0	15	8	0	A
Guilio Romano
........	15
.........	16	4	14	A

The last School column contains the information of school classification of the painters. The schools are named as A, B, ...,etc, and the School variable is qualitative.
 
For further details of the paintersdata set, please consult the R documentation.

The frequency distribution of a data variable is a summary of the data occurrence in a collection of non-overlapping categories.
Example

In the data set painters, the frequency distribution of the School variable is a summary of the number of painters in each school.
Problem

Find the frequency distribution of the painter schools in the data set painters.

Solution

We apply the table function to compute the frequency distribution of the School variable.

Answer

The frequency distribution of the schools is:
