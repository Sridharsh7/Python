Method overriding in Python is a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When a method in a subclass has the same name, return type, and parameters as a method in its superclass, the method in the subclass overrides the one in the superclass.

In this example:

The Animal class has a method sound that returns a generic animal sound.

The Dog and Cat classes inherit from the Animal class and override the sound method to provide specific sounds for dogs and cats, respectively.

When calling the sound method on instances of Dog and Cat, the overridden methods in the respective subclasses are called instead of the method in the superclass Animal.
