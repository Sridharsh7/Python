Aim:
To study and demonstrate the use of logical operators (and, or, not) in Python.


Procedure:
1.	Open Python (IDLE, Jupyter Notebook, or any IDE).
2.	Declare boolean variables with values True or False.
3.	Apply logical operators and, or, and not on the variables.
4.	Display the results using the print() function.
5.	Execute the program and verify the output.


Program (Code):
# Exercise: Logical Operators in Python


# Declaring boolean variables x = True
y = False


# Applying logical operators print("x =", x, " y =", y)
print("x and y:", x and y) # True only if both are True print("x or y:", x or y)	 # True if at least one is True print("not x:", not x)	# Negates the value of x print("not y:", not y)	# Negates the value of y

Output:
x = True y = False x and y: False
x or y: True
 
not x: False not y: True

Result:
The program was executed successfully. Logical operators and, or, and not were demonstrated with boolean values, and their truth table behavior was verified.
