Aim:
To understand the concept of functions in Python and learn how to define and call them for code reusability.


Procedure:
1.	Open Anaconda Navigator and launch Jupyter Notebook (or any Python IDE).
2.	Create a new Python file or notebook.
3.	Define a function using the def keyword.
o	Example:
o	def greet(name):
o	print("Hello,", name, "Welcome to Python Programming!")
4.	Call the function with different arguments (values).
5.	greet("Alice")
6.	greet("Bob")
7.	Execute the program and observe the output.


Code Example:
# Defining a function def greet(name):
"""This function greets the person by name""" print("Hello,", name, "Welcome to Python Programming!")

# Calling the function with arguments greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")


Output:
 
Hello, Alice Welcome to Python Programming! Hello, Bob Welcome to Python Programming!

Result:
The concept of functions in Python was successfully implemented.
We learned how to define a function, pass parameters, and call the function to achieve reusable and modular code.
