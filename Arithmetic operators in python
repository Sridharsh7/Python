Aim:
To study and demonstrate the use of arithmetic operators in Python.


Procedure:
1.	Open Python (IDLE, Jupyter Notebook, or any IDE).
2.	Declare numeric variables and assign values.
3.	Apply arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %, **) on the variables.
4.	Use the print() function to display results for each operator.
5.	Execute the program and verify the output.


Program (Code):
# Exercise: Arithmetic Operators in Python


# Declaring variables
a = 15
b = 4


# Applying arithmetic operators print("a =", a, " b =", b) print("Addition (a + b):", a + b) print("Subtraction (a - b):", a - b) print("Multiplication (a * b):", a * b) print("Division (a / b):", a / b) print("Floor Division (a // b):", a // b) print("Modulus (a % b):", a % b)
print("Exponentiation (a ** b):", a ** b)
 
Output:
a = 15 b = 4
Addition (a + b): 19 Subtraction (a - b): 11 Multiplication (a * b): 60 Division (a / b): 3.75 Floor Division (a // b): 3 Modulus (a % b): 3
Exponentiation (a ** b): 50625


Result:
The program was executed successfully. Different arithmetic operators in Python were applied on numeric variables, and their results were displayed.
