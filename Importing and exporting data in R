AIM:
To importing and exporting the data using R Programming
PROCEDURE:
The sample data can also be in comma separated values (CSV) format. Each cell inside such data file is separated by a special character, which usually is a comma, although other characters can be used as well.
The first row of the data file should contain the column names instead of the actual data. Here is a sample of the expected format.
After we copy and paste the data above in a file named "mydata.csv" with a text editor, we can read the data with the function read.csv.
