Aim:
To study and implement control structures in Python, including conditional statements (if, if- else, if-elif-else) and loops (for, while).


Procedure:
1.	Open Python (IDLE, Jupyter Notebook, or any IDE).
2.	Write a program to demonstrate:
o	Decision-making using if, if-else, and if-elif-else.
o	Iteration using for loop and while loop.
3.	Print appropriate outputs for each case.
4.	Execute the program and verify the results.


Program (Code):
# Exercise: Control Structures in Python


# 1. Conditional Statements num = 10

# if statement if num > 0:
print("Number is positive")


# if-else statement if num % 2 == 0:
print("Number is even") else:
print("Number is odd")
 
# if-elif-else statement if num < 0:
print("Number is negative") elif num == 0:
print("Number is zero") else:
print("Number is positive")


print("	")


# 2. Looping Statements


# for loop
print("For loop: Printing numbers from 1 to 5") for i in range(1, 6):
print(i)


print("	")


# while loop
print("While loop: Printing numbers from 1 to 5") i = 1
while i <= 5: print(i)
i += 1


Output:
Number is positive Number is even Number is positive
 
 

For loop: Printing numbers from 1 to 5 1
2
3
4
5


While loop: Printing numbers from 1 to 5 1

3

5


Result:
The program was executed successfully. Different control structures in Python (if, if-else, if-elif- else, for loop, and while loop) were demonstrated with correct outputs.
